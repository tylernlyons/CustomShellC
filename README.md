## Description
A custom shell program that functions nearly identical to that of SSH. My shell parses the command line for user input and utilizes multi-threading to allow for file piping. Basic UNIX commands are also available like cd, ls, exit, cat and more. 

## Development
I would like to further pursue this program in adding input and output redirection.
